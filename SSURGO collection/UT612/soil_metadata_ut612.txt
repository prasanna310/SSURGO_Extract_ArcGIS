  Description:
    Abstract:
      This data set is a digital soil survey and generally is the most
      detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the National
      Cooperative Soil Survey. The information was prepared by digitizing
      maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base
      and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely
      sensed and other information.

      This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and
      computerized attribute data. The map data are in a soil survey area
      extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory
      of soils and miscellaneous areas that normally occur in a repeatable
      pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at
      the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line
      features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features
      too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large
      enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and
      management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the
      National Soil Information System relational database, which gives
      the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.
    Purpose:
      SSURGO depicts information about the kinds and distribution of
      soils on the landscape. The soil map and data used in the SSURGO
      product were prepared by soil scientists as part of the National
      Cooperative Soil Survey.
    Supplemental_Information:
      Digital versions of hydrography, cultural features, and other
      associated layers that are not part of the SSURGO data set may be
      available from the primary organization listed in the Point of
      Contact.

    The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation
    Service, should be acknowledged as the data source in products
    derived from these data.

    This data set is not designed for use as a primary regulatory tool
    in permitting or citing decisions, but may be used as a reference
    source. This is public information and may be interpreted by
    organizations, agencies, units of government, or others based on
    needs; however, they are responsible for the appropriate
    application. Federal, State, or local regulatory bodies are not to
    reassign to the Natural Resources Conservation Service any
    authority for the decisions that they make. The Natural Resources
    Conservation Service will not perform any evaluations of these maps
    for purposes related solely to State or local regulatory programs.

    Photographic or digital enlargement of these maps to scales greater
    than at which they were originally mapped can cause misinterpretation
    of the data. If enlarged, maps do not show the small areas of
    contrasting soils that could have been shown at a larger scale. The
    depicted soil boundaries, interpretations, and analysis derived from
    them do not eliminate the need for onsite sampling, testing, and
    detailed study of specific sites for intensive uses. Thus, these data
    and their interpretations are intended for planning purposes only.
    Digital data files are periodically updated. Files are dated, and
    users are responsible for obtaining the latest version of the data.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      The attribute accuracy is tested by manual
      comparison of the source with hard copy plots and/or symbolized
      display of the map data on an interactive computer graphic system.
      Selected attributes that cannot be visually verified on plots or
      on screen are interactively queried and verified on screen. In
      addition, the attributes are tested against a master set of valid
      attributes. All attribute data conform to the attribute codes in
      the signed classification and correlation document and amendment(s).
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    Certain node/geometry and topology GT- polygon/chain relationships
    are collected or generated to satisfy topological requirements
    (the GT-polygon corresponds to the soil delineation). Some of these
    requirements include: chains must begin and end at nodes, chains
    must connect to each other at nodes, chains do not extend through
    nodes, left and right GT-polygons are defined for each chain
    element and are consistent throughout, and the chains representing
    the limits of the file are free of gaps. The tests of logical
    consistency are performed using vendor software. All internal
    polygons are tested for closure with vendor software and are checked
    on hard copy plots. All data are checked for common soil lines (i.e.,
    adjacent polygons with the same label). Edge locations generally do
    not deviate from centerline to centerline by more than 0.01 inch.
    The boundary of this survey is matched to the adjacent SSURGO
    certified surveys of Davis-Weber Area, Utah; Morgan Area, Utah -
    Morgan County and Part of Weber County; Summit Area, Utah, Parts of
    Summit, Salt Lake, and Wasatch Counties; Utah County, Utah - Central
    Part; Fairfield-Nephi Area, Utah; and Toole Area, Utah - Tooele County and Parts of Box Elder,
    Davis and Juab Counties, Utah White Pine and Elko Counties, Nevada.
    Feature edges and labels do not match.
  Completeness_Report:
    A map unit is a collection of areas defined and named in terms of
    their soil components or miscellaneous areas or both. Each map
    unit differs in some respect from all others in a survey area and
    each map unit has a symbol that uniquely identifies the map unit
    on a soil map. Each individual area, point, or line so identified
    on the map is a delineation.

    Soil Scientists identify small areas of soils or miscellaneous areas
    that have properties and behavior significantly different than the
    named soils in the surrounding map unit. These minor components
    may be indicated as special features. If they have a minimal effect
    on use and management, or could not be precisely located, they may
    not be indicated on the map.

    A map unit has specified kinds of soils or miscellaneous areas
    (map unit components), each with a designated range in
    proportionate extent. Map units include one or more kinds of soil
    or miscellaneous area. Miscellaneous areas are areas that have little
    or no recognizable soil.

    Specific National Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures
    were used in the classification of soils, design and name of map
    units, and location of special soil features. These standards are
    outlined in Agricultural Handbook 18, Soil Survey Manual, 1993,
    USDA, NRCS; Agricultural Handbook 436, Soil Taxonomy, 1995,
    USDA, NRCS; and all Amendments; Keys to Soil Taxonomy,
    (current issue) USDA, NRCS; National Soil Survey
    Handbook, title 430-VI,(current issue) USDA, NRCS.

    The actual composition and interpretive purity of the map unit
    delineations were based on data collected by scientists during
    the course of preparing the soil maps. Adherence to National
    Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures is based on
    peer review, quality control, and quality assurance. Quality
    control is outlined in the memorandum of understanding for the
    soil survey area and in documents that reside with the Natural
    Resources Conservation Service state soil scientist. Four kinds
    of map units are used in soil surveys: consociations, complexes,
    associations, and undifferentiated groups.

    Consociations - Consociations are named for the dominant soil.
    In a consociation, delineated areas use a single name from the
    dominant component in the map unit. Dissimilar components are
    minor in extent. The soil component in a consociation may be
    identified at any taxonomic level. Soil series is the lowest
    taxonomic level. A consociation that is named as a miscellaneous
    area is dominantly that kind of area and minor components do not
    significantly affect the use of the map unit. The total amount of
    dissimilar inclusions of other components in a map unit generally
    does not exceed about 15 percent if limiting and 25 percent if
    nonlimiting. A single component of a dissimilar limiting inclusion
    generally does not exceed 10 percent if very contrasting.

    Complexes and associations - Complexes and associations consist
    of two or more  dissimilar components that occur in a regularly
    repeating pattern. The total amount of other dissimilar components
    is minor extent. The following arbitrary rule determines whether
    complex or association is used in the name. The major components
    of an association can be separated at the scale of mapping. In
    either case, because the major components are sufficiently different
    in morphology or behavior, the map unit cannot be called a
    consociation. In each delineation of a complex or an association,
    each major component is normally present though their proportions
    may vary appreciably from one delineation to another. The total
    amount of inclusions in a map unit that are dissimilar to any of
    the major components does not exceed 15 percent if limiting and
    25 percent if nonlimiting. A single kind of dissimilar limiting
    inclusion usually does not exceed 10 percent.

    Undifferentiated groups - Undifferentiated groups consist of two
    or more components that are not consistently associated
    geographically and, therefore, do not always occur together in
    the same map delineation. These components are included in the
    same named map unit because their use and management are the same
    or very similar for common uses. Generally they are grouped together
    because some common feature, such as steepness, stoniness, or
    flooding, determines their use and management. If two or more
    additional map units would serve no useful purpose, they may be
    included in the same unit. Each delineation has at least one of the
    major components, and some may have all of them. The same principles
    regarding the proportion of minor components that apply to
    consociations also apply to undifferentiated groups. The same
    principles regarding proportion of inclusion apply to
    undifferentiated groups as to consociations.

    Minimum documentation consists of three complete soil profile
    descriptions that are collected for each soil added to the legend,
    one additional per 3,000 acres mapped; three 10 observation
    transects for each map unit, one additional 10 point transect per
    3,000 acres.

    A defined standard or level of confidence in the interpretive
    purity of the map unit delineations is attained by adjusting the
    kind and intensity of field investigations. Field investigations
    and data collection are carried out in sufficient detail to name
    map units and to identify accurately and consistently areas of
    about 5 acres in areas of 2nd order survey, and about 10 acres in
    areas of 3rd order survey.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        The accuracy of these digital data is based upon their
        compilation to base maps that meet National Map
        Accuracy Standards at a scale of 1 inch equals 1,000
        feet. The difference in positional accuracy between the
        soil boundaries and special soil features locations in the
        field and their digitized map locations is unknown. The
        locational accuracy of soil delineations on the ground varies
        with the transition between map units.

        For example, on long gently sloping landscapes the transition
        occurs gradually over many feet. Where landscapes change
        abruptly from steep to level, the transition will be very
        narrow. Soil delineation boundaries and special soil features
        generally were digitized within 0.01 inch of their locations on
        the digitizing source. The digital map elements are edge matched
        between data sets. The data along each quadrangle edge are
        matched against the data for the adjacent quadrangle. Edge
        locations generally do not deviate from centerline to centerline
        by more than 0.01 inch.

      Process_Description:
        Field procedures for second and third order soil survey were
        utilized to plot soil boundaries by field observations and by
        interpreting remotely sensed data. Boundaries were verified at
        closely spaced intervals and the soils in each delineation were
        identified by traversing and transecting the landscape. Soil
        scientists described and sampled the soils and analyzed samples
        in the laboratory. The classification and correlation of map unit
        names was finalized in August 1967, and the Soil Survey of Salt
        Lake Area, Utah was published in 1974 at a scale of 1:20,000.

        Information on field maps was compiled to annotated overlays,
        using 1:24,000 orthophoto quadrangles and 7.5 minute topographic
        quadrangles as a base reference.

      Process_Description:
        Annotated overlays were raster scanned and converted to vector
        format using R2V software for Windows NT. Soils and special
        feature symbols were hand digitized from 1:24,000 scale annotated
        overlays. Digital processing and editing were performed using
        ARC/INFO version 7.2.1. The soil survey boundary was edge matched
        to the adjacent SSURGO certified soil survey boundaries of
        Davis-Weber Area, Utah; Utah County, Utah - Central Part;
        Fairfield-Nephi Area, Utah; Morgan Area, Utah - Morgan County
        and Part of Weber County; Toole Area, Utah - Tooele County and
        Parts of Box Elder, Davis and Juab Counties, Utah, White Pine and
        Elko Counties, Nevada. Custom AMLs were operated for error
        identification and the data were written to DLG-3 Optional
        format. Cartographic technicians at the NRCS Regional Digitizing
        Center in Salina, Kansas completed the digitizing work and review
        for adherence to SSURGO standards.

        In the total acres for Salt Lake Area, Utah, there is a
        discrepancy of approximately 61,260 acres between the spatial
        acres (399,381) and the NASIS acres (460,641). This discrepancy
        was caused by a portion of the Great Salt Lake not being included
        into the spatial area and the map unit symbols "PT" and "UL" were
        calculated into the NASIS acres but not the spatial acres.

        added to the Salt Lake City North, Fort Douglas, Salt Lake City
        South and Sugar House quadrangles. A polygon labeled 'PT' was
        added to the Bingham Canyon and Lark quadrangles. Also during
        this revision, the extent of the soil survey boundary was matched
        to that of the adjacent SSURGO certified survey of Summit Area,
        Utah, Parts of Summit, Salt Lake and Wasatch Counties. Editing
        and review for adherence to SSURGO standards were done by
        cartographic staff at the NRCS Regional Digitizing Center in
        Salina, Kansas, using ArcGIS version 8.3. The certified data were
        uploaded to the NRCS Soil Data Warehouse for archiving and

        Landsat scenes from P38R31 and P38R32, May 21, 2003 were mosaicked
        together, and the area of wet and saline soils adjacent to the
        Great Salt Lake was subset from the mosaicked image. A supervised
        classification of land cover types was performed using the fuzzy
        classification algorithm and the fuzzy convolution filter options
        in ERDAS Imagine. Land cover types were related to soil types. The
        resulting classification was field validated with an accuracy
        assessment, and used as base material for updating soil lines. All
        image processing and analysis was completed by a soil scientist.

      Process_Description:
        The data were imported into ArcMap by a soil scientist in the Utah
        State University (USU) Soil Survey Satellite Office in Logan,
        Utah. Soil lines were edited on screen in ArcMap, referencing the
        digital orthophoto quadrangles, digital raster graphics, and
        Landsat 7 supervised classification. Only the portion of the
        survey area adjacent to the Great Salt Lake was updated. All new
        map units in the updated portion of the survey area were given
        symbols containing all capital letters. Adjustments were made to
        the soil lines and labels along the survey boundary in the updated
        portion of the survey area by an NRCS soil scientist to achieve a
        perfect join with surrounding Utah soil survey areas. Labeling and
        error checking were done in ArcMap. Adjustments to the survey area
        boundary were made to include previously excluded parts of the

        Scientist or delegate verified that the labels on the digitized soil map
        units link to map units in the tabular database, and certified the joined
        data sets for release to the Soil Data Warehouse. A system assigned version
        number and date stamp were added and the data were copied to the data warehouse.
        Data elements were updated, and validated in 2006 to accommodate current modeling
        needs. The tabular data for the map units and components were extracted from the
        data warehouse and reformatted into the soil data delivery data model, then stored
        in the Soil Data Mart. The spatial data were copied to the Soil Data Mart without change.

        The spatial data for the Soil Survey of Salt Lake Area, Utah
        was downloaded from the Soil Data Mart on October 15, 2012.  The
        individual shapefiles were appended into a geodatabase for Region 8.
        The data were processed in ARCGIS 10.1 using a topology object with
        a 0.1 meter cluster tolerance for the purpose of eliminating gaps and
        overlaps within the Region 8 soils geodatabase.  Individual soil
        survey area data were exported as shapefiles from the regional
        geodatabase.  A datum transformation from NAD83 to WGS84 using the
        NAD_1983_To_WGS_1984_1 datum transformation method was applied to
        the data.  The data were checked with the SSURGO Evaluation scripts
        provided by U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources
        Conservation Service. The shapefiles were then uploaded to the
        soil data warehouse for archival and distribution.

  Overview_Description:
    Entity_and_Attribute_Overview:
      Map Unit Delineations are closed polygons that may be dominated
      by a single soil or miscellaneous area component plus allowable
      similar or dissimilar soils, or they can be geographic mixtures
      of groups of soils or soils and miscellaneous areas.

      The map unit symbol uniquely identifies each closed map unit
      delineation. Each symbol corresponds to a map unit name. The map
      unit key is used to link to information in the National Soil
      Information System tables.

      Map Unit Delineations are described by the National Soil
      Information System database. This attribute database gives the
      proportionate extent of the component soils and the properties for
      each soil. The database contains both estimated and measured data
      on the physical and chemical soil properties and soil
      interpretations for engineering, water management, recreation,
      agronomic, woodland, range, and wildlife uses of the soil.

      The National Soil Information System database contains static
      metadata. It documents the data structure and includes such
      information as what tables, columns, indexes, and relationships
      are defined as well as a variety of attributes of each of these
      database objects. Attributes include table and column
      descriptions and detailed domain information.

      The National Soil Information System database also contains a
      distribution metadata. It records the criteria used for selecting
      map units and components for inclusion in the set of distributed
      data.

      Special features are described in the feature table.  It includes
      an area symbol, feature label, feature name, and feature description
      for each special and ad hoc feature in the survey area.
