"UT612"|5|"ESO"|"Escarpment, nonbedrock"|"A relatively continuous and steep slope or cliff, which generally is produced by erosion but can be produced by faulting, that breaks the continuity of more gently sloping land surfaces.  Exposed earthy material is nonsoil or very shallow soil."|"197438"
"UT612"|5|"GPI"|"Gravel pit"|"An open excavation from which soil and underlying material have been removed and used, without crushing, as a source of sand or gravel.  Typically 3 to 5 acres."|"197439"
"UT612"|5|"GRA"|"Gravelly spot"|"A spot where the surface layer has more than 35 percent, by volume, rock fragments that are mostly less than 3 inches in diameter in an area with less than 15 percent fragments.  Typically 3 to 5 acres."|"197440"
"UT612"|5|"GUL"|"Gully"|"A small channel with steep sides cut by running water through which water ordinarily runs only after a rain, or after ice or snow melts.  It generally is an obstacle to wheeled vehicles and is too deep to be obliterated by ordinary tillage."|"197441"
"UT612"|5|"LVS"|"Levee"|"An embankment that confines or controls water, especially one built along the banks of a river to prevent overflow of lowlands."|"197442"
"UT612"|5|"MAR"|"Marsh or swamp"|"A water saturated, very poorly drained area, intermittently or permanently covered by water.  Sedges, cattails, and rushes dominate marsh areas.  Trees or shrubs dominate swamps.  Not used in map units where the named components are poorly or very poorly drained."|"197443"
"UT612"|5|"ROC"|"Rock outcrop"|"An exposure of bedrock at the surface of the earth.  Not used where the named soils of the surrounding map unit are shallow over bedrock or where 'Rock outcrop' is a named component of the map unit.  Typically 3 to 5 acres."|"197444"
"UT612"|5|"STN"|"Stony spot"|"A spot where 0.01 to 0.1 percent of the surface cover is rock fragments that are greater than 10 inches in diameter in areas where the surrounding soil has no surface stones.  Typically 3 to 5 acres."|"197445"
"UT612"|5|"WET"|"Wet spot"|"A somewhat poorly drained to very poorly drained area that is at least two drainage classes wetter than the named soils in the surrounding map unit.  Typically 3 to 5 acres."|"197446"
