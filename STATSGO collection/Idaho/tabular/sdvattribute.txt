It is assumed that the irrigation system is adapted to the soils and to the crops grown, that good-quality irrigation water is uniformly applied as needed, and that tillage is kept to a minimum.

In the database, some states maintain crop yield data by individual map unit component and others maintain the data at the map unit level. Attributes are included in this application for both, although only one or the other is likely to have data for any given geographic area. This attribute uses data maintained at the map unit component level.

The yields are actually recorded as three separate values in the database. A low value and a high value indicate the range for the soil component. A ""representative"" value indicates the expected value for the component. For these yields, only the representative value is used.

The yields are based mainly on the experience and records of farmers, conservationists, and extension agents. Available yield data from nearby areas and results of field trials and demonstrations also are considered.

The management needed to obtain the indicated yields of the various crops depends on the kind of soil and the crop. Management can include drainage, erosion control, and protection from flooding; the proper planting and seeding rates; suitable high-yielding crop varieties; appropriate and timely tillage; control of weeds, plant diseases, and harmful insects; favorable soil reaction and optimum levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and trace elements for each crop; effective use of crop residue, barnyard manure, and green manure crops; and harvesting that ensures the smallest possible loss.

471|"Soil Taxonomy Classification"|"component"|"taxclname"|"String"|120||"This rating presents the taxonomic classification based on Soil Taxonomy.

The system of soil classification used by the National Cooperative Soil Survey has six categories (Soil Survey Staff, 1999 and 2003). Beginning with the broadest, these categories are the order, suborder, great group, subgroup, family, and series. Classification is based on soil properties observed in the field or inferred from those observations or from laboratory measurements. This table shows the classification of the soils in the survey area. The categories are defined in the following paragraphs.

ORDER. Twelve soil orders are recognized. The differences among orders reflect the dominant soil-forming processes and the degree of soil formation. Each order is identified by a word ending in sol. An example is Alfisols.

SUBORDER. Each order is divided into suborders primarily on the basis of properties that influence soil genesis and are important to plant growth or properties that reflect the most important variables within the orders. The last syllable in the name of a suborder indicates the order. An example is Udalfs (Ud, meaning humid, plus alfs, from Alfisols).

GREAT GROUP. Each suborder is divided into great groups on the basis of close similarities in kind, arrangement, and degree of development of pedogenic horizons; soil moisture and temperature regimes; type of saturation; and base status. Each great group is identified by the name of a suborder and by a prefix that indicates a property of the soil. An example is Hapludalfs (Hapl, meaning minimal horizonation, plus udalfs, the suborder of the Alfisols that has a udic moisture regime).

SUBGROUP. Each great group has a typic subgroup. Other subgroups are intergrades or extragrades. The typic subgroup is the central concept of the great group; it is not necessarily the most extensive. Intergrades are transitions to other orders, suborders, or great groups. Extragrades have some properties that are not representative of the great group but do not indicate transitions to any other taxonomic class. Each subgroup is identified by one or more adjectives preceding the name of the great group. The adjective Typic identifies the subgroup that typifies the great group. An example is Typic Hapludalfs.

FAMILY. Families are established within a subgroup on the basis of physical and chemical properties and other characteristics that affect management. Generally, the properties are those of horizons below plow depth where there is much biological activity. Among the properties and characteristics considered are particle-size class, mineralogy class, cation-exchange activity class, soil temperature regime, soil depth, and reaction class. A family name consists of the name of a subgroup preceded by terms that indicate soil properties. An example is fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Typic Hapludalfs.

SERIES. The series consists of soils within a family that have horizons similar in color, texture, structure, reaction, consistence, mineral and chemical composition, and arrangement in the profile.

191|"Conservation Tree and Shrub Group"|"component"|"constreeshrubgrp"|"Choice"|254||"Each tree and shrub species has certain climatic and physiographic limits. Within these parameters, trees and shrubs may be well suited or poorly suited to a given environment because of climate or site or soil characteristics. On the basis of the performance of individual species to specific conditions of soil, climate, physiography, and management, Conservation Tree and Shrub Groups (CTSGs) have been developed. Individual soils have been grouped with similar soils into one of the 10 main CTSGs. Most of these main groups are further divided into subgroups.

This interpretation provides guidance in selecting the species best suited to each of the groups of soils within each vegetative zone. It also can be used for predicting survival, height, growth, species attributes, and effectiveness and for selecting species for windbreaks, riparian plantings, recreation and wildlife plantings, and ornamental or environmental plantings.

Tree and shrub species associated with each CTSG are broken down by vegetative zones (rainfall zones). These lists are available in the local office of the USDA, Natural Resources Conservation Service, or on the Web in the electronic Field Office Technical Guide. Because vegetative zones are rather large, climatic differences within a zone should be considered when species are recommended for planting. For example, some species adapted to the eastern end of a zone may be inadequately adapted to the western end. Care must be taken to ensure that conditions on individual sites are considered when species suitability and performance are determined. A case-by-case decision may be necessary to determine which CTSG is most appropriate when an individual site has characteristics that differ from those of the CTSG in which it occurs. These differences occur because of inclusions of other soils, site modifications (such as leveling and drainage manipulation), soil pH (calcareous sites), irrigation, soil amendments, or other factors."|||"Property"||||0|1|0|0||0|||-1|"ConsTSG"||||||||0||||"Centimeters"|0|||"Weighted Average"|0|0||1|8||"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""8""><ColorRampType type=""0"" name=""Random""><Values min=""50"" max=""99"" /><Saturation min=""33"" max=""66"" /><Hue start=""0"" end=""360"" /></ColorRampType><Legend_Symbols shapeType=""polygon""><Styles fillStyle=""esriSFSSolid"" /><Font type=""Times New Roman"" size=""8"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /><Line type=""outline"" width=""0.4"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /></Legend_Symbols><Legend_Elements transparency=""0""><Labels value=""1"" label=""1"" order=""1"" /><Labels value=""1A"" label=""1A"" order=""2"" /><Labels value=""1H"" label=""1H"" order=""3"" /><Labels value=""1K"" label=""1K"" order=""4"" /><Labels value=""1KK"" label=""1KK"" order=""5"" /><Labels value=""1S"" label=""1S"" order=""6"" /><Labels value=""1SK"" label=""1SK"" order=""7"" /><Labels value=""1SKK"" label=""1SKK"" order=""8"" /><Labels value=""2"" label=""2"" order=""9"" /><Labels value=""2A"" label=""2A"" order=""10"" /><Labels value=""2H"" label=""2H"" order=""11"" /><Labels value=""2K"" label=""2K"" order=""12"" /><Labels value=""2KK"" label=""2KK"" order=""13"" /><Labels value=""3"" label=""3"" order=""14"" /><Labels value=""3A"" label=""3A"" order=""15"" /><Labels value=""4"" label=""4"" order=""16"" /><Labels value=""4A"" label=""4A"" order=""17"" /><Labels value=""4C"" label=""4C"" order=""18"" /><Labels value=""4CA"" label=""4CA"" order=""19"" /><Labels value=""4CC"" label=""4CC"" order=""20"" /><Labels value=""4CK"" label=""4CK"" order=""21"" /><Labels value=""4K"" label=""4K"" order=""22"" /><Labels value=""5"" label=""5"" order=""23"" /><Labels value=""5A"" label=""5A"" order=""24"" /><Labels value=""5K"" label=""5K"" order=""25"" /><Labels value=""5KK"" label=""5KK"" order=""26"" /><Labels value=""6"" label=""6"" order=""27"" /><Labels value=""6A"" label=""6A"" order=""28"" /><Labels value=""6D"" label=""6D"" order=""29"" /><Labels value=""6DA"" label=""6DA"" order=""30"" /><Labels value=""6DK"" label=""6DK"" order=""31"" /><Labels value=""6G"" label=""6G"" order=""32"" /><Labels value=""6GA"" label=""6GA"" order=""33"" /><Labels value=""6GK"" label=""6GK"" order=""34"" /><Labels value=""6GKK"" label=""6GKK"" order=""35"" /><Labels value=""6K"" label=""6K"" order=""36"" /><Labels value=""6KK"" label=""6KK"" order=""37"" /><Labels value=""7"" label=""7"" order=""38"" /><Labels value=""7A"" label=""7A"" order=""39"" /><Labels value=""8"" label=""8"" order=""40"" /><Labels value=""8K"" label=""8K"" order=""41"" /><Labels value=""9C"" label=""9C"" order=""42"" /><Labels value=""9L"" label=""9L"" order=""43"" /><Labels value=""9N"" label=""9N"" order=""44"" /><Labels value=""9NW"" label=""9NW"" order=""45"" /><Labels value=""9W"" label=""9W"" order=""46"" /><Labels value=""10"" label=""10"" order=""47"" /><Labels value=""Not applicable"" label=""Not applicable"" order=""48"" /></Legend_Elements></Map_Legend>"|1|02/28/2007 14:15:09|"Dominant Condition"||1|"Choice"

16|"Hydric Rating by Map Unit"|"component"|"hydricrating"|"Choice"|254||"This rating indicates the proportion of map units that meets the criteria for hydric soils. Map units are composed of one or more map unit components or soil types, each of which is rated as hydric soil or not hydric. Map units that are made up dominantly of hydric soils may have small areas of minor nonhydric components in the higher positions on the landform, and map units that are made up dominantly of nonhydric soils may have small areas of minor hydric components in the lower positions on the landform. Each map unit is designated as ""hydric,"" ""predominantly hydric,"" ""partially hydric,"" ""predominantly nonhydric,"" or ""nonhydric"" depending on the rating of its respective components and the percentage of each component within the map unit.

""Hydric"" means that all components listed for a given map unit are rated as being hydric. ""Predominantly hydric"" means components that comprise 66 to 99 percent of the map unit are rated as hydric. ""Partially hydric"" means components that comprise 33 to 66 percent of the map unit are rated as hydric.  ""Predominantly nonhydric"" means components that comprise up to 33 percent of the map unit are rated as hydric.  ""Nonhydric"" means that none of the components are rated as hydric. The assumption here is that all components of the map unit are rated as hydric or nonhydric in the underlying database.  A ""Not rated or not available"" map unit rating is displayed when none of the components within a map unit have been rated.

Hydric soils are defined by the National Technical Committee for Hydric Soils (NTCHS) as soils that formed under conditions of saturation, flooding, or ponding long enough during the growing season to develop anaerobic conditions in the upper part (Federal Register, 1994). Under natural conditions, these soils are either saturated or inundated long enough during the growing season to support the growth and reproduction of hydrophytic vegetation.

The NTCHS definition identifies general soil properties that are associated with wetness. In order to determine whether a specific soil is a hydric soil or nonhydric soil, however, more specific information, such as information about the depth and duration of the water table, is needed. Thus, criteria that identify those estimated soil properties unique to hydric soils have been established (Federal Register, 2002). These criteria are used to identify map unit components that normally are associated with wetlands. The criteria used are selected estimated soil properties that are described in ""Soil Taxonomy"" (Soil Survey Staff, 1999) and ""Keys to Soil Taxonomy"" (Soil Survey Staff, 2006) and in the ""Soil Survey Manual"" (Soil Survey Division Staff, 1993).

If soils are wet enough for a long enough period of time to be considered hydric, they should exhibit certain properties that can be easily observed in the field. These visible properties are indicators of hydric soils. The indicators used to make onsite determinations of hydric soils are specified in ""Field Indicators of Hydric Soils in the United States"" (Hurt and Vasilas, 2006).

66|"Available Water Supply, 0 to 100 cm"|"muaggatt"|"aws0100wta"|"Float"||2|"Available water supply (AWS) is the total volume of water (in centimeters) that should be available to plants when the soil, inclusive of rock fragments, is at field capacity. It is commonly estimated as the amount of water held between field capacity and the wilting point, with corrections for salinity, rock fragments, and rooting depth. AWS is reported as a single value (in centimeters) of water for the specified depth of the soil. AWS is calculated as the available water capacity times the thickness of each soil horizon to a specified depth.

For each soil layer, available water capacity, used in the computation of AWS, is recorded as three separate values in the database. A low value and a high value indicate the range of this attribute for the soil component. A ""representative"" value indicates the expected value of this attribute for the component. For the derivation of AWS, only the representative value for available water capacity is used.

The available water supply for each map unit component is computed as described above and then aggregated to a single value for the map unit by the process described below.

A map unit typically consists of one or more ""components."" A component is either some type of soil or some nonsoil entity, e.g., rock outcrop. For the attribute being aggregated (e.g., available water supply), the first step of the aggregation process is to derive one attribute value for each of a map unit's components. From this set of component attributes, the next step of the process is to derive a single value that represents the map unit as a whole. Once a single value for each map unit is derived, a thematic map for the map units can be generated. Aggregation is needed because map units rather than components are delineated on the soil maps.

The composition of each component in a map unit is recorded as a percentage. A composition of 60 indicates that the component typically makes up approximately 60 percent of the map unit.

For the available water supply, when a weighted average of all component values is computed, percent composition is the weighting factor."|"centimeters"|"cm"|"Property"||||1|0|0|0||1|||1|"AWS100"||||||||0|||||0|||"Weighted Average"|0|0||1|3|5|"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""3""><ColorRampType type=""1"" name=""Progressive"" count=""3""><LowerColor part=""0"" algorithm=""1"" red=""255"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /><UpperColor part=""0"" algorithm=""1"" red=""255"" green=""255"" blue=""0"" /><LowerColor part=""1"" algorithm=""1"" red=""255"" green=""255"" blue=""0"" /><UpperColor part=""1"" algorithm=""1"" red=""0"" green=""255"" blue=""255"" /><LowerColor part=""2"" algorithm=""1"" red=""0"" green=""255"" blue=""255"" /><UpperColor part=""2"" algorithm=""1"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""255"" /></ColorRampType><Legend_Symbols shapeType=""polygon""><Styles fillStyle=""esriSFSSolid"" /><Font type=""Times New Roman"" size=""8"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /><Line type=""outline"" width=""0.4"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /></Legend_Symbols><Legend_Elements transparency=""0"" classes=""5"" /></Map_Legend>"|1|02/28/2007 13:32:20|"No Aggregation Necessary"||1|"Float"

7|"Available Water Supply, 0 to 150 cm"|"muaggatt"|"aws0150wta"|"Float"||2|"Available water supply (AWS) is the total volume of water (in centimeters) that should be available to plants when the soil, inclusive of rock fragments, is at field capacity. It is commonly estimated as the amount of water held between field capacity and the wilting point, with corrections for salinity, rock fragments, and rooting depth. AWS is reported as a single value (in centimeters) of water for the specified depth of the soil. AWS is calculated as the available water capacity times the thickness of each soil horizon to a specified depth.

For each soil layer, available water capacity, used in the computation of AWS, is recorded as three separate values in the database. A low value and a high value indicate the range of this attribute for the soil component. A ""representative"" value indicates the expected value of this attribute for the component. For the derivation of AWS, only the representative value for available water capacity is used.

The available water supply for each map unit component is computed as described above and then aggregated to a single value for the map unit by the process described below.

A map unit typically consists of one or more ""components."" A component is either some type of soil or some nonsoil entity, e.g., rock outcrop. For the attribute being aggregated (e.g., available water supply), the first step of the aggregation process is to derive one attribute value for each of a map unit's components. From this set of component attributes, the next step of the process is to derive a single value that represents the map unit as a whole. Once a single value for each map unit is derived, a thematic map for the map units can be generated. Aggregation is needed because map units rather than components are delineated on the soil maps.

The composition of each component in a map unit is recorded as a percentage. A composition of 60 indicates that the component typically makes up approximately 60 percent of the map unit.

For the available water supply, when a weighted average of all component values is computed, percent composition is the weighting factor."|"centimeters"|"cm"|"Property"||||1|0|0|0||1|||1|"AWS150"||||||||0|||||0|||"Weighted Average"|0|0||1|3|5|"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""3""><ColorRampType type=""1"" name=""Progressive"" count=""3""><LowerColor part=""0"" algorithm=""1"" red=""255"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /><UpperColor part=""0"" algorithm=""1"" red=""255"" green=""255"" blue=""0"" /><LowerColor part=""1"" algorithm=""1"" red=""255"" green=""255"" blue=""0"" /><UpperColor part=""1"" algorithm=""1"" red=""0"" green=""255"" blue=""255"" /><LowerColor part=""2"" algorithm=""1"" red=""0"" green=""255"" blue=""255"" /><UpperColor part=""2"" algorithm=""1"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""255"" /></ColorRampType><Legend_Symbols shapeType=""polygon""><Styles fillStyle=""esriSFSSolid"" /><Font type=""Times New Roman"" size=""8"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /><Line type=""outline"" width=""0.4"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /></Legend_Symbols><Legend_Elements transparency=""0"" classes=""5"" /></Map_Legend>"|1|02/28/2007 13:33:24|"No Aggregation Necessary"||1|"Float"

The AASHTO classification system has two general classifications: (i) granular materials having 35 percent or less, by weight, particles smaller than 0.074 mm in diameter and (ii) silt-clay materials having more than 35 percent, by weight, particles smaller than 0.074 mm in diameter. These two divisions are further subdivided into seven main group classifications, plus eight subgroups, for a total of fifteen for mineral soils. Another class for organic soils is used.

For each soil horizon in the database one or more AASHTO Group Classifications may be listed.  One is marked as the representative or most commonly occurring.  The representative classification is shown here for the surface layer of the soil."|||"Property"||||0|1|0|1||0|||-1|"AASHTO"|"chaashto.rvindicator = 'yes'"|||||||0|"Surface Layer"|||"Centimeters"|0|||"Weighted Average"|0|0||1|8||"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""8""><ColorRampType type=""0"" name=""Random""><Values min=""50"" max=""99"" /><Saturation min=""33"" max=""66"" /><Hue start=""0"" end=""360"" /></ColorRampType><Legend_Symbols shapeType=""polygon""><Styles fillStyle=""esriSFSSolid"" /><Font type=""Times New Roman"" size=""8"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /><Line type=""outline"" width=""0.4"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /></Legend_Symbols><Legend_Elements transparency=""0""><Labels value=""A-1"" label=""A-1"" order=""1"" /><Labels value=""A-1-a"" label=""A-1-a"" order=""2"" /><Labels value=""A-1-b"" label=""A-1-b"" order=""3"" /><Labels value=""A-2"" label=""A-2"" order=""4"" /><Labels value=""A-2-4"" label=""A-2-4"" order=""5"" /><Labels value=""A-2-5"" label=""A-2-5"" order=""6"" /><Labels value=""A-2-6"" label=""A-2-6"" order=""7"" /><Labels value=""A-2-7"" label=""A-2-7"" order=""8"" /><Labels value=""A-3"" label=""A-3"" order=""9"" /><Labels value=""A-4"" label=""A-4"" order=""10"" /><Labels value=""A-5"" label=""A-5"" order=""11"" /><Labels value=""A-6"" label=""A-6"" order=""12"" /><Labels value=""A-7"" label=""A-7"" order=""13"" /><Labels value=""A-7-5"" label=""A-7-5"" order=""14"" /><Labels value=""A-7-6"" label=""A-7-6"" order=""15"" /><Labels value=""A-8"" label=""A-8"" order=""16"" /></Legend_Elements></Map_Legend>"|1|08/10/2007 09:21:08|"Dominant Condition"||1|"Choice"
52|"Frost Action"|"component"|"frostact"|"Choice"|254||"Potential for frost action is the likelihood of upward or lateral expansion of the soil caused by the formation of segregated ice lenses (frost heave) and the subsequent collapse of the soil and loss of strength on thawing. Frost action occurs when moisture moves into the freezing zone of the soil. Temperature, texture, density, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), content of organic matter, and depth to the water table are the most important factors considered in evaluating the potential for frost action. It is assumed that the soil is not insulated by vegetation or snow and is not artificially drained. Silty and highly structured, clayey soils that have a high water table in winter are the most susceptible to frost action. Well drained, very gravelly, or very sandy soils are the least susceptible.

ASTM D 2487 shows the criteria chart used for classifying soil in the Unified system and the 15 basic soil groups of the system and the plasticity chart for the Unified system.

The various groupings of this classification correlate in a general way with the engineering behavior of soils. This correlation provides a useful first step in any field or laboratory investigation for engineering purposes. It can serve to make some general interpretations relating to probable performance of the soil for engineering uses.

Soils are assigned to one of four groups according to the rate of water infiltration when the soils are not protected by vegetation, are thoroughly wet, and receive precipitation from long-duration storms.

The soils in the United States are assigned to four groups (A, B, C, and D) and three dual classes (A/D, B/D, and C/D). The groups are defined as follows:

Group A. Soils having a high infiltration rate (low runoff potential) when thoroughly wet. These consist mainly of deep, well drained to excessively drained sands or gravelly sands. These soils have a high rate of water transmission.

Group B. Soils having a moderate infiltration rate when thoroughly wet. These consist chiefly of moderately deep or deep, moderately well drained or well drained soils that have moderately fine texture to moderately coarse texture. These soils have a moderate rate of water transmission.

Group C. Soils having a slow infiltration rate when thoroughly wet. These consist chiefly of soils having a layer that impedes the downward movement of water or soils of moderately fine texture or fine texture. These soils have a slow rate of water transmission.

Group D. Soils having a very slow infiltration rate (high runoff potential) when thoroughly wet. These consist chiefly of clays that have a high shrink-swell potential, soils that have a high water table, soils that have a claypan or clay layer at or near the surface, and soils that are shallow over nearly impervious material. These soils have a very slow rate of water transmission.

If a soil is assigned to a dual hydrologic group (A/D, B/D, or C/D), the first letter is for drained areas and the second is for undrained areas.
