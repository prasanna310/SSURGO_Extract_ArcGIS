  Description:
    Abstract:
      This data set consists of general soil association units. It was
      develped by the National Cooperative Soil Survey and supersedes
      the State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) data set published in 1994.
      It consists of a broad based inventory of soils and nonsoil areas
      that occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can
      be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. The data set was
      created by generalizing more detailed soil survey maps. Where more
      detailed soil survey maps were not available, data on geology,
      topography, vegetation, and climate were assembled, together with
      Land Remote Sensing Satellite (LANDSAT) images. Soils of like areas
      were studied, and the probable classification and extent of the soils
      were determined.

      Map unit composition was determined by transecting or sampling areas
      on the more detailed maps and expanding the data statistically to
      characterize the whole map unit.

      This data set consists of georeferenced vector digital data and
      tabular digital data. The map data were collected in 1-by 2-degree
      topographic quadrangle units and merged into a seamless national
      data set. It is distributed in state/territory and national extents.
      The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil
      Information System data base which gives the proportionate extent of
      the component soils and their properties.
    Purpose:
      These data provide information about soil features on or near the
      surface of the Earth. Data were collected as part of the National
      Cooperative Soil Survey. These data are intended for geographic
      display and analysis at the state, regional, and national level.
      The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for
      1:250,000-scale data.

  Use_Constraints:
    The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation
    Service should be acknowledged as the data source in products
    derived from these data. Hardcopies utilizing these data shall
    clearly indicate their source. User agrees not to misrepresent these
    data, nor to imply that changes made were approved by the Natural
    Resources Conservation Service.

    The Digital General Soil Map of U.S. was designed primarily for
    regional, multicounty, river basin, State, and multistate resource
    planning, management, and monitoring. Data are not detailed enough
    to make interpretations at a county level. This soil survey product
    is not designed for use as a primary regulatory tool in permitting
    or citing decisions, but may be used as a reference source. The use
    of these data is not restricted and may be interpreted by organizations,
    agencies, units of government, or others; however, they are responsible
    for its appropriate application. Federal, State, or local regulatory
    bodies are not to reassign to the Natural Resources Conservation
    Service any authority for the decisions that they make. The Natural
    Resources Conservation Service will not perform any evaluations of
    these maps for purposes related solely to state or local regulatory
    programs.

    When data from the Digital General Soil Map of U.S. are overlayed
    with other data layers, such as land use data, caution must be
    used in generating statistics on the co-occurence of the land use
    data with the soil data. The composition of the soil map unit can
    be characterized independently for the land use and for the soil
    component, but there are no data on their joint occurrence at a
    more detailed level. Analysis of the overlayed data should be on a
    map polygon basis.

    Additional political, watershed, or other boundaries may be
    intersected with the soil data. Although the composition of each
    political and watershed unit may be described in terms of the
    soil map units, information is not available to assign the
    components to the boundary units with full accuracy. As with the
    land use categories, the analysis should be restricted to the
    classified components.

    The approximate minimum area delineated is 625 hectares
    (1,544 acres), which is represented on a 1:250,000-scale map by
    an area approximately 1 cm by 1 cm (0.4 inch by 0.4 inch). Linear
    delineations are not less than 0.5 cm (0.2 inch) in width. The
    number of delineations per 1:250,000 quadrangle typically is 100
    to 200, but may range up to 400. Delineations depict the dominant
    soils making up the landscape. Other dissimilar soils, too small
    to be delineated, are present within a delineation.

    Digital enlargements of these data to scales greater than at
    which they were originally mapped can cause misinterpretation
    of the data. If enlarged, maps do not show the small areas of
    contrasting soils that could have been shown at a larger scale.
    The depicted soil boundaries, interpretations, and analysis
    derived from them do not eliminate the need for onsite sampling,
    testing, and detailed study of specific sites for intensive uses.
    Thus, these data and their interpretations are intended for
    planning purposes only.

    Data values for some data elements may be incomplete or missing.
    Where data are unavailable, a mask should be used to exclude the
    area from analysis.

    The spatial and tabular data used to create this product are
    periodically updated. Data are versioned, and users are responsible
    for obtaining the latest version of the product.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      Accuracy is tested by manual comparison of the source with hard
      copy plots and/or symbolized display of the map data on an
      interactive computer graphic system. Selected  attributes that
      cannot be visually verified on plots or on screen are interactively
      queried and verified on screen. In addition, the attributes
      are tested against a master set of valid attributes. All attribute
      data conform to the attribute codes in the signed classification
      and correlation document and amendments and are current as of
      the date of digitizing.
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    Certain node/geometry and topology (GT)-polygon/chain
    relationships are collected or generated to satisfy topological
    requirements. (The GT-polygon corresponds to the soil delineation).
    Some of these requirements include: chains must begin and end at
    nodes, chains must connect to each other at nodes, chains do not
    extend through nodes, left and right GT-polygons are defined for
    each chain element and are consistent throughout, and the chains
    representing the limits of the file (neatline) are free of gaps.
    The tests of logical consistency are performed using vendor
    software. The neatline is generated by connecting the explicitly
    entered four corners of the digital file. All data outside the
    enclosed region are ignored and all data crossing these
    geographically straight lines are clipped at the neatline. Data
    within a specified tolerance of the neatline are snapped to the
    neatline. Neatline straightening aligns the digitized edges of
    the digital data with the generated neatline (i.e., with the
    longitude/latitude lines in geographic coordinates). All internal
    polygons are tested for closure with vendor software and are
    checked on hard copy plots. All data are checked for common soil
    lines (i.e., adjacent polygons with the same label). Quadrangles
    are edge matched within the state, merged into a statewide data
    sets, and then edge matched to adjacent state data sets. Edge
    locations do not deviate from centerline to centerline by more
    than 0.01 inch.
  Completeness_Report:
    A map unit is a collection of areas defined and named the same
    in terms of their soil and/or nonsoil areas. Each map unit differs
    in some respect from all others in a survey area and is uniquely
    identified. Each individual area is a delineation. Each map unit
    in the Digital General Soil Map of U.S. consists of one to more
    than 21 components.

    In those few areas where detailed maps did not exist,
    reconnaissance soil surveys were combined with data on geology,
    topography, vegetation, climate, and remote sensing images to
    delineate map units and estimate the percentages of components.
    Map unit components in this product are soil series phases, and
    their percent composition represents the estimated areal proportion
    of each within a map unit. The composition for a map unit is
    generalized to represent the statewide extent of that map unit
    and not the extent of any single map unit delineation. These
    specifications provide a nationally consistent representation of
    the associated attribute data.

    The actual composition and interpretive purity of the map unit
    delineations were based on statistical analysis of transect data.
    The composition was largely determined by measuring transects on
    detailed soil survey maps. The number of transects used was
    proportional to the relative size, number, and complexity of the
    delineations. The combined data on the length of the map units
    crossed by the transects were used to determine the percentages
    of the different soil and nonsoil areas in each map unit.

    Specific National Cooperative Soil Survey Standards and
    procedures were used in the classification of soils, design and
    name of map units. These standards are outlined in U.S. Department
    of Agriculture. 2nd Ed., 1999. Soil Taxonomy: A basic system of
    soil classification for making and interpreting soil surveys.
    Nat. Res. Conserv. Serv., U.S. Dep. Agric. Handb. 436.; U.S.
    Department of Agriculture. 9th Ed., 2003. Keys to Soil Taxonomy.

    Agriculture. Current Issue. National Soil Survey Handbook, title

    Department of Agriculture. 1993. Soil Survey Manual. Soil Surv.
    Staff, U.S. Dep. Agric. Handbook 18.

    Adherence to National Cooperative Soil Survey standards and
    procedures is based on peer review, quality control, and quality
    assurance. Quality control is outlined in documents that reside
    with the Natural Resources Conservation Service state soil
    scientist.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        The accuracy of these digital data is based upon their
        compilation to base maps that meet National Map Accuracy
        Standards. The difference in positional accuracy between
        the map unit boundaries in the field and their digitized
        map locations is unknown. The locational acuracy of soil
        delineations on the ground varies with the transition
        between map units.

        For example, in areas where changes in soils, climate,
        topography, and geology occur subtly across a portion of a
        state, the transition between soil map unit boundaries will
        be gradual. Where these features change abruptly, such as
        from an area of foothills to a lake plain, the transition
        will be very narrow. Soil delineation boundaries were
        digitized within 0.01 inches of their locations on the
        digitizing source. The digital map elements are edge matched
        between data sets. The data along each state boundary are
        matched against the data for the adjacent state. Edge
        locations generally do not deviate from centerline to
        centerline by more than 0.01 inch.

  Overview_Description:
    Entity_and_Attribute_Overview:
      Map Unit Delineations are closed polygons that are geographic
      mixtures of groups of soils or soils and nonsoil areas.

      The map unit key uniquely identifies each closed map unit
      delineation. Each map unit key is linked to a map unit symbol
      and a map unit name. The map unit key is also the key for linking
      information in the National Soil Information System tables.

      Map Unit Delineations are described by the National Soil
      Information System data base. This attribute data base gives the
      proportionate extent of the component soils and the properties
      for each soil. The data base contains both estimated and measured
      data on the physical and chemical soil properties and soil
      interpretations for engineering, water management, recreation,
      agronomic, woodland, range and wildlife uses of the soil.

      The National Soil Information System data base contains static
      metadata. It documents the data structure and includes such
      information as what tables, columns, indexes, and relationships
      are defined as well as a variety of attributes of each of these
      data base objects. Attributes include table and column descriptions
      and detailed domain information.

      The National Soil Information System data base also contains
      distribution metadata. It records the criteria used in the set
      of distributed data.
