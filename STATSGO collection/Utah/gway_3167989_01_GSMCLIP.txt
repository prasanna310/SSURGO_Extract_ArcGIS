    The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Service Center Agencies should be acknowledged as the data source in products derived from these data.

    This data set is not designed for use as a primary regulatory tool in permitting or citing decisions, but may be used as a reference source.  This information may be interpreted by organizations, agencies, units of government, or others based on needs; however, they are responsible for the appropriate application.  Federal, State, or local regulatory bodies are not to reassign to the Service Center Agencies any authority for the decisions that they make.  The Service Center Agencies will not perform any evaluations of these data for purposes related solely to State or local regulatory programs.

    Photographic or digital enlargement of these data to scales greater than at which they were originally mapped can cause misinterpretation of the data.  Digital data files are periodically updated, and users are responsible for obtaining the latest version of the data.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Map unit composition was determined by transecting or 
sampling areas on the more detailed soil maps and expanding 
the data statistically to characterize the whole map unit.

Soil map unit lines and symbols were drafted in red pencil
on a mylar overlay that was punch registered to fit the mylar
USGS 1:250,000-scale topographic quadrangle. A detailed and
complete edit was performed on all overlays before digitizing.
The soil delineation overlays were raster scanned at a
scanning resolution of at least 0.01 inches and converted to
a vector format or were manually digitized on a digitizing
tablet with a resolution of at least 0.001 inches. Four
control points corresponding to the four corners of the
quadrangles were used for registration during data collection.
The control points were either explicitly entered or developed
by the software. The data sets were edge matched and merged
into statewide coverages. A detailed and complete edit was
performed on all digital data.

State coverages were merged into a seamless national coverage.
This reduced tabular data redundancy and polygon number. A detailed
and complete edit was performed on all digital data.

  Overview_Description:
    Entity_and_Attribute_Overview:
      Map Unit Delineations are closed polygons that are geographic
mixtures of groups of soils or soils and nonsoil areas.

The map unit key uniquely identifies each closed map unit
delineation. Each map unit key is linked to a map unit symbol
and a map u
    Entity_and_Attribute_Detail_Citation: AREASYMBOL - A symbol that uniquely identifies a single occurrence of a particular type of area (e.g. Lancaster Co., Nebraska is NE109)
MUSYM - The symbol used to uniquely identify the soil map unit in the soil survey.
MUKEY -  A non-connotative string of characters used to uniquely identify a record in the Mapunit table.
SPATIALVERSION - A sequential integer number used to denote the serial version of the spatial data for a soil survey area.
